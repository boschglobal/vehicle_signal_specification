IsHVACActivated:
  datatype: boolean
  type: actuator
  description: Is HVAC system on. When false fans and air conditioning is deactivated.

IsRecirculationActive:
  datatype: boolean
  type: actuator
  description: Is recirculation active.
  
IsAutoRecirculationActive:
  datatype: boolean
  type: actuator
  description: Indicates if system automatically shall change to recirculation mode if incoming air quality is low.

IsFrontDefrosterActive:
  datatype: boolean
  type: actuator
  description: Is front defroster active.
  comment: This signal refer to or control both electric defroster (if existing) and fan-based defroster.

IsRearDefrosterActive:
  datatype: boolean
  type: actuator
  description: Is rear defroster active.

IsAirConditioningActive:
  datatype: boolean
  type: actuator
  description: Is Air conditioning active.

IsAirConditioningMaxOn:
  datatype: boolean
  type: actuator
  description: Indicates if air condition system is in max mode.
               In max mode the VAC system shall try to cool the vehicle as much and fast as possible.

AmbientAirTemperature:
  datatype: float
  type: sensor
  unit: celsius
  description: Ambient air temperature inside the vehicle.

IsIndividualMode:
  datatype: boolean
  type: actuator
  description: Indicates if individual mode is on.
               True = changing fan speed and temperature for one HVAC station change it only for that station.
               False = changing fan speed and temperature on master HVAC station shall change it for all HVAC stations.
  comment: The master HVAC station is typically the HVAC station controlled by the driver.
           A vehicle may automatically change to IsIndividualMode=True if someone change temperature or fan speed on other HVAC stations.
           IsIndividualMode=True is sometimes referred to as dual mode. IsIndividualMode=False is sometimes referred to as synchronized mode.
